1. Class and Obj (example)
2. Class has data/attribute and func/methods
    > Code walkthrough
    > attributes get called itself, methods are called manually
3. Why Python is called OOP? - everything in Python is an object (data structure, data type etc)
4. Advantages of OOPS:
    > You can create your own datatype
    > code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab


5. End to end Project (Chatbook class)
    > function vs method
    > magic method or dunder method
    > self
    > You can create attribute outside class as well

    > encapsulation
    > getter and setter
    > static method

6. Inheritance

Inheritance code example

Why inheritance is needed?
(Code reusability, parent has no access to child class)

What gets inherited?
(Constructor, non-private attributes, non-private methods)

Constructor overloading & method overloading

super keyword
(Can be used only inside class, cannot access variables/attributes, used only inside child class)

Why this and super keywords are different?

Types of inheritance:

Single inheritance

Multilevel inheritance

Hierarchical inheritance

Multiple inheritance (Diamond problem)

Hybrid inheritance
